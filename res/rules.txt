Goal of the Game.
The goal is to capture all opponent's pieces or block all their possible moves.

Moving a Piece.
Regular pieces move diagonally forward by one square, on black tiles only.

Capturing a Piece.
If a player can capture an opponent's piece, they must do so.
Capturing is done by jumping over an adjacent opponent's piece.
Multiple captures are allowed (and required) if possible.

Queen Piece.
When a piece reaches the last row of the opponent's side, it becomes a Queen.
A Queen can move both forward and backward diagonally by one square.
Capturing with a Queen works the same way.

Turn Order.
Players take turns. If a player has no legal moves, they lose.
